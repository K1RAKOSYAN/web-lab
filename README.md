# Let's Make a Cake! 🎂

A fun and interactive web project to learn and practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while "baking" a virtual cake. This project is perfect for beginners looking to explore web development concepts like animations, theming, and grid layouts.

## Features

- **CSS:** Adding playful styles, animations, and theming support.
- **JavaScript:** Enabling dynamic theming and animations for a more interactive experience.

## How It Works
- Hover over the egg emoji (🥚) to see it jump with excitement.
- Change the theme between light and dark modes in the JavaScript file.
- Play with the CSS grid layout to rearrange ingredients.
- Experiment with the animations to customize their behavior.
